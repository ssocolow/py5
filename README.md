# py5
A p5.js inspired graphics library for python

## Dependencies
py5 uses tkinter under the hood to make graphics.  Tkinter usuall comes preinstalled on systems, but if you don't have it then 
you can install it (if you have the apt package manager) with this command:
`sudo apt-get install python-tk`

## Files
py5.py contains the py5 graphics library

testingpy5.py is a test of the library, so if it works and you see some balls bouncing strangely when you run it, then the library
should be working.
